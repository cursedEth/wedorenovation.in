# wedorenovation.in

A website built with reactjs for a client who runs a local home renovation company. The design was created in Figma and it has features like google maps integration, programmatically created pages, several advanced components, etc. Apart from building the site, I am also responsible for creating the logo, optimizing the images, and writing the content for the website. In the end, I deployed it to Netlify with the client's custom domain and installed the SSL certificate.
